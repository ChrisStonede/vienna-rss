/*
The source strings were generated by -_generateFormattingDictionaryStringsFile
of NSPredicateEditor (see the NSPredicateEditor+Private.h file). When changing
any NSPredicateEditorRowTemplate instances, remember to also generate strings.

The source strings (left) are based on SQL column names, NSPredicate operators,
scalar values and constant values as well as text. These source strings should
match all possible NSPredicateEditorRowTemplate combinations, so that each one
can be localized to display differently in the UI.

NSPredicateEditor dynamically creates the UI based on these strings. Localized
strings must include the same number of arguments as their source strings, but
the arguments can be rearranged, with the exception of the first argument. Any
text within square brackets is displayed as a (pop-up) button title or a menu-
item title; text outside of the square brackets is displayed as a label instead.
You can combine strings by including mutiple variants in the square brackets.

NSPredicateEditor will create a row of UI components for each string, but will
merge arguments where possible into pop-up buttons or menus to avoid duplicate
entries. The format should therefore be as consistent as possible across each
group of strings.
